## Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
    s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Feedback from ChatGPT-3.5 on Solution:

Your JavaScript code looks good and it effectively detects valid anagrams. However, there are some optimizations that you can make to improve its performance:

Reduce the use of the "in" operator: The "in" operator checks if an object has a property with a given name. While it's useful in some cases, it's not very efficient when used in loops. Instead, you can use an array to store the count of letters, and access it using the character code of each letter as the index.

Use charCodeAt() instead of accessing characters directly: Accessing characters using s[i] or t[i] can be slow, especially if the strings are long. You can use charCodeAt() to get the character code of a letter instead, which is faster.

Use a single loop instead of two: You can combine the two loops that iterate over s and t into a single loop that updates the letter counts for both strings.
