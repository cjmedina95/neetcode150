## Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:

Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:

Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= strs.length <= 104
    0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
    strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

## ChatGPT-4 Feedback On Solution

Your current solution for finding anagrams has a time complexity of O(n * mlogm), where n is the number of strings in the input array and m is the maximum length of a string. The space complexity is O(n * m), as the uniqueAnagrams object will store n strings with a maximum length of m.

In terms of time complexity, your solution is already optimized. However, you can simplify your code a little and slightly reduce space complexity by eliminating the separate loop for creating anagramGroups.

Changes made:

    Replaced the uniqueAnagrams object with a Map. Maps have better performance in scenarios involving frequent additions and removals of key-value pairs.
    Changed the if statement in the loop to use the Map methods has() and get().
    Removed the second loop that created the anagramGroups array, and used Array.from(uniqueAnagrams.values()) to return the array of anagram groups directly from the map.

This modified solution still has a time complexity of O(n * mlogm) and a space complexity of O(n * m). Note that, while this solution has been simplified and slightly improved in terms of space complexity, it is not a significant improvement. The algorithm's time complexity remains the same since sorting is the bottleneck.
